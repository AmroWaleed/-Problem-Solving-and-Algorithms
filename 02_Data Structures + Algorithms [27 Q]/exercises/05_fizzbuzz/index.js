// --- Directions
// Write a program that console logs the numbers
// from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print
// “fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples
// of five print “buzz”. For numbers which are multiples
// of both three and five print “fizzbuzz”.
// --- Example
//   fizzBuzz(5);
//   1
//   2
//   fizz
//   4
//   buzz
/**
 * we should to have an array of counts fron 1 to n
 * eterate over array and console log all the numbers in array
 * but if we have anumber that multiples of three console log 'fizz'
 * and if we have a number that multiples of five console log 'buzz' 
 * if we have both console log fizzbuzz
